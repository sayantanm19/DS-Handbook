## From the Developer

This was a project to learn Android development in **Flutter**, and Data Structures was a relevant topic to me. I learnt a lot about Flutter and general Android Development from this project. The companion website is created for a quick revision. and those who don't want to necessarily download the app.

Most of the material is verified by me from multiple sources, however as always, the developer won't take any responsibility if you fail your exam or your supposedly ***Turbo*** IDE/Compiler crashed.
